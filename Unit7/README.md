## 🔍 What is Binary Search?

Binary Search is a super-efficient search algorithm that helps you find the position of a target value within a sorted array. Imagine having a magical magnifying glass 🔎 that allows you to quickly zoom in on the target by comparing it to the middle element of the array. If the target matches the middle element, you've found it! 🎯 If not, the search continues in either the lower or upper half of the array, depending on whether the target is smaller or larger. This process repeats until the target is found or the subarray is empty. 🧙‍♂️✨
