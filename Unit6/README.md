# 🎸 Unit 6: Linked List II 🎶

Welcome to Unit 6! In this unit, we dive deeper into the fascinating world of Linked Lists. Get ready to explore new concepts and enhance your understanding of this essential data structure. Let's rock and roll! 🤘

## 📚 What is a Linked List?

A linked list is a dynamic data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes. Each node contains:
- **Data**: The value or information stored in the node.
- **Link**: A reference to the next node in the sequence.

The first node is known as the **head**, and the last node is the **tail**, which points to `null`, indicating the end of the list.

## 🎵 Part A Theme: Music Concerts

In Part A, we'll use linked lists to manage and organize data related to music concerts. Imagine creating a playlist or managing a queue of songs at a concert! 🎤

## 🏙️ Part B Theme: Investigating the City

Part B takes us on an adventure through the city, where we'll use linked lists to solve problems and uncover hidden gems. Whether it's mapping out a route or managing city data, linked lists are your trusty guide! 🗺️
