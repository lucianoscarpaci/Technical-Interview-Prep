# 🌳 Unit 8: Binary Trees

Welcome to **Unit 8** of the Intermediate Technical Interview Prep course! 🎉 In this unit, we will dive into the fascinating world of **binary trees**, a fundamental data structure in computer science. Let's embark on this journey together! 🚀

## 🌲 What is a Binary Tree?

A **binary tree** is a hierarchical data structure where each node has at most two children, known as the left child and the right child. The topmost node is called the **root**, and each node can have zero, one, or two children. 🌿

Binary trees are widely used in various applications, including:
- 📂 Representing hierarchical data (e.g., file systems, organizational charts)
- 🔍 Implementing search algorithms (e.g., binary search trees)
- 📊 Storing sorted data (e.g., AVL trees, red-black trees)
- 🏆 Implementing priority queues (e.g., heaps)
