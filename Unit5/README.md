# ðŸŽ“ Unit 5: OOP and Linked Lists ðŸš€

Welcome to Unit 5! In this unit, we dive into the fascinating world of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and explore the intricacies of linked lists. Get ready to enhance your programming skills and tackle complex data structures with ease! ðŸ’ª

## ðŸ¤” What is OOP and Linked Lists?

**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code to manipulate that data. OOP allows for modular, reusable, and organized code. Key concepts include classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

**Linked Lists** are a type of data structure that consists of nodes, where each node contains data and a reference to the next node in the sequence. Linked lists are dynamic, allowing for efficient insertion and deletion of elements.

## ðŸ§© Part A Theme: OOP

In Part A, we will explore the core principles of OOP:
- **Classes and Objects**: Learn how to define classes and create objects.
- **Inheritance**: Understand how to create a hierarchy of classes.
- **Encapsulation**: Discover how to protect data within classes.
- **Polymorphism**: Implement methods that can operate on objects of different classes.

## ðŸ”— Part B Theme: Linked Lists

Part B focuses on linked lists and their applications:
- **Singly Linked Lists**: Learn how to implement and traverse a singly linked list.
- **Doubly Linked Lists**: Explore the benefits of having references to both previous and next nodes.
- **Circular Linked Lists**: Understand how to create a circular structure for efficient looping.

## ðŸ“š Part C: Advanced Problem Set 1
This part will challenge you with advanced problems that require a deep understanding of OOP and linked lists. Get ready to flex those coding muscles! ðŸ’ª

## ðŸ“š Part D: Advanced Problem Set 2
In this section, you'll tackle even more complex problems that combine OOP principles with linked list operations. This is your chance to demonstrate mastery of the concepts learned in previous parts. ðŸš€


## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

By the end of this unit, you will be able to:
- Apply OOP principles to design robust and maintainable code.
- Implement various types of linked lists and understand their use cases.
- Solve complex problems using OOP and linked lists.
