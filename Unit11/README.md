# 🚀 Unit 11: Graphs II — Matrices & Zombie Apocalypse 🧟‍♂️

Welcome to **Unit 11** of your Technical Interview Prep!  
Get ready to dive into the fascinating world of **graphs** and see how they can help you survive a zombie apocalypse! 🧠✨

## 🕸️ What Are Graphs?

Graphs are everywhere — from social networks to city maps!  
Here's what you need to know:

- **Nodes** 🟢: The individual elements (think: people, places, or things).
- **Edges** 🔗: The connections between nodes.
- **Directed or Undirected** ➡️↔️: Edges can have direction (like one-way streets) or not.

> **Fun Fact:**  
> Graphs help us model relationships and solve real-world problems!

## 🧮 Part A: Graphs as Matrices

Did you know you can turn a graph into a matrix?  
A **matrix** is just a grid of numbers, and it's a powerful way to represent connections!

- **Matrix**: A 2D array of numbers.
- **Adjacency Matrix**: Shows which nodes are connected.
- **Why?** Fast lookups and easy computations!

## 🧟‍♀️ Part B: The Zombie Apocalypse Scenario

Imagine a virus is spreading...  
How do we model who gets infected? With graphs and matrices, of course!

- **Scenario**: People = nodes, connections = edges.
- **Matrix**: Shows who can infect whom.
- **Goal**: Use graph theory to outsmart the zombies!
