# ✈️🌐 Unit 10: Graphs — Flight Paths & Algorithms! 🌐✈️

Welcome to **Unit 10** of the Intermediate Technical Interview Prep course!  
Get ready to soar through the fascinating world of **graphs** — the backbone of many real-world problems and technical interviews! 🚀

---

## 🧭 What’s Inside?

In this unit, you’ll learn how to **build** and **manipulate** different representations of graphs, and master the most common algorithms to traverse and search through them. Whether you’re charting flight paths or booking tickets, graphs are everywhere! 🗺️

## 🛫 Part A Theme: Graphing Flights

Visualize and model flight connections between cities!  
Can you find the shortest route from New York to Tokyo? 🌍

---

## 🧳 Part B Theme: Flight Booking

Simulate booking flights and managing routes.  
How do airlines optimize connections and costs? 💸

---
