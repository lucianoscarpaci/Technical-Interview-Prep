## 🤔 What is Dynamic Programming?

Dynamic Programming (DP) is like having a magical toolbox for solving tough problems by breaking them into smaller, manageable pieces!  
It shines when:
- Problems can be split into **overlapping subproblems** 🔄
- You need to find the **best** or **most efficient** solution 🏆

DP is your go-to for optimization and counting problems—think of it as your algorithmic Swiss Army knife! 🛠️

## 🧮 Part B: Counting Ways & Pathfinding

Ever wondered how many ways you can reach the end of a maze? 🗺️  
DP helps you:
- **Count combinations** and **arrangements** 🔢
- **Find paths** in grids or graphs 🗂️
- Tackle classic problems like climbing stairs, coin change, and more! 🪙🪜
